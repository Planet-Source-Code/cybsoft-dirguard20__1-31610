### Description

Dirguard guards a directory for changes like addig files, deletions, renaming, adding / deleting subdirectorys.

Some other small gadget have also been inserted in the code.

This is an update of previous version(s) and also the final version so i made it 2.0, i would like to spend more time on it but a new project awaits.

Please rate this code and report problems / questions or comments to me.

The code is tested on WIN-NT (4-sp6) and Win98(SE) and worked fine (WIN-NT users read the code-comment for additional information).
